Write a function to generate a date string given numeric values for month, 
day, and year, and a language. The valid languages are "US English", 
"British English", "French", and "German".

If US English is specified the returned string should be in the format of
month day, year. For all other languages the returned string should use the
European standard of day month year.

In your function, use lists to store the month names.

You can assume that the numeric inputs to the function are valid. 

Example outputs:
January 25, 2022
25 Januar 2022

Write a test function to test your date function. Test January, December,
and some month in the middle.
